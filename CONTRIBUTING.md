## Development Guidelines

### Dockerfile Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Versions**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:24.04  # Good
   FROM ubuntu        # Bad
   ```

2. **Minimize Layers**
   ```dockerfile
   # Good
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y package1 package2 && \
       apt-get clean && \
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   
   # Bad
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN apt-get install -y package1
   RUN apt-get install -y package2
   ```

3. **Run as Non-Root**
   ```dockerfile
   USER webera
   ```

4. **Add Health Checks**
   ```dockerfile
   HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
     CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
   ```

### Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add Ruby 3.3 support
fix: correct PHP memory limit setting
docs: update README with new examples
```

### Testing

Before submitting a PR:

1. **Build the Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t test-image ./images/your-image
   ```

2. **Run Basic Tests**
   ```bash
   # Check if the image runs
   docker run --rm test-image
   
   # Check installed versions
   docker run --rm test-image [command] --version
   ```

3. **Test with Examples**
   ```bash
   cd examples/your-example
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Documentation

Update documentation for:
- New features or images
- Changed behavior
- New examples
- Configuration options

## Image Guidelines

### New Images Should:
- Inherit from `webera/base`
- Use Ubuntu 24.04 as the base
- Run services as non-root
- Expose only necessary ports
- Include health checks
- Have minimal dependencies
- Include clear documentation

### Example Structure:
```
images/new-image/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â””â”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ build.sh
    â””â”€â”€ config-files/
```
